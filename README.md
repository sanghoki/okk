# Login-Registration_Form
JAVA, JDBC, JSP, CSS, MySql, JAVA SERVLET

INTRODUCTION
In this small project of login/Registeration I have tried to show a demo of how a java servlet works. Apart from that I have used new
techniques to make my website more beautiful and attractive (Mainly using CSS).

FEATURES
Eclipse oxygen
Apachey Tomcat v8.5
Contains servlets
CSS
JSP
JDBC concepts

This project contains a login page which after autherization directs you to the registration form page where an employee can put in the
details. These details will then be served by servlet class and that class will store the details back in the database.

Motivation?
In orde to understand servlet, one must practice it. This project helped me to understand how actually a servlet works in java eclipse 
oxygen with apache tomcat server v8.5 with a table names industry. 
I have configured web.xml file that will help you to understand how servlet mapping takes place in java.

NOTE: DO NOT FORGET TO PUT MYSQL_CONNECTOR.JAR FILE IN LIB FOLDER
